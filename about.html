<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a creative mind looking to broaden my horizon. The clever thoughts I come up with are not by mistake, but by choice.
  I challenge myself to be creative and well educated. I believe that an individual should read whatever
  subject matter comes to mind. The most important thing is that he or she reads. I take pressure in my quest for knowledge.
  Trying to learn Spanish is hard but also rewarding. </p>

<p>As financial woes progress too an even tougher landscape, it is rewarding to know that I have the financial knowledge to
  battle through them. I try to teach people that I come across how to navigate their own funds and future funds. I 
  know that this is an impossible dream, but I wish that each person had the financial knowledge to make educated decisions about their money.
</p>

<p>See, can you tell that I overly value education. Maybe I should have became a high school teacher. My thoughts are clever because
  I challenge myself to think but not over think. My creative side stems from my ability to see things differently. I guess all
  in all, I could have created a poem or used a Psalm to express myself, however, I would have been showing of and that is not
  my character.
